## üìù Working with Notebooks

### Option 1: Direct Workspace (Simplest)
1. **Upload notebooks**: Import all from `course/notebooks/` to your workspace
2. **Upload datasets**: Import sample data from `course/datasets/`
3. **Create catalogs**: Follow notebook instructions for manual catalog creation
4. **Start learning**: Begin with Week 1

### Option 2: Sync from Local Repository
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd databricks-infra

# 2. Install Databricks CLI  
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh
databricks auth login

# 3. Sync notebooks to workspace
databricks workspace import-dir course/notebooks /Shared/course-notebooks --overwrite
```
